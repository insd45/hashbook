# hashbook
This is a C program that acts similarly to Facebook, but primarily uses HashTables. The hash table hashes person objects by the first letter of their name, and chains by linked list at collisions.  In addition, a person object's friend list is also a linked list that runs with an insertion time of O(1), making for a very fast and simple "Facebook" done entirely in C.
